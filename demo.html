                            The Czech Republic is probably most famous for its great variety of pilsner beers, but the
                            country also serves up some tasty Czech foods to soak up all that alcohol. One of the
                            must-eat dishes in Prague are palacinky pancakes. These crepe-like desserts are filled with
                            fruit jam and served rolled up.

                            Currywurst is a German national dish consisting of hot pork sausage cut into slices and
                            seasoned with curry sauce (regularly consisting of ketchup or tomato paste blended with
                            curry) and generous amounts of curry powder, or a ready-made ketchup-based sauce seasoned
                            with curry and other spices. French fries or bread rolls serve as a side dish.

                            try it in Naples. If you can. Oh, and if you’re not in Italy — might consider trying it at

                            In the Netherlands, it’s all about the herring. As a seafaring country, fish has always been
                            a part of the national diet. With the unique Dutch herring preservation process, the small
                            silvery fish has become a symbol of Dutch food. It’s best to eat during the first catch of
                            the season.

                            oven. Just about Vinegar will serve the dish outside France.

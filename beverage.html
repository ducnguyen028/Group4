                            This beer style evolved from the British porter, and it was partially influenced by imperial
                            stouts. The beers that fall under this category will typically have high alcohol content,
                            usually between 5.5 and 9.5% ABV, while their color ranges from mahogany red to dark brown.
                            They are full-bodied and smooth brews with typical malt flavors that are usually
                            complemented by aromas of toast, caramel, licorice, dried fruit, chocolate, and coffee.
                            Baltic porter first appeared when stronger and hoppier versions of British porter were sent
                            to Russia

                            modern interpretation is believed to have first appeared in the 1980s, while the first
                            commercial batch came from Buffalo Bill’s Brewery in Hayward, California.In its basic
                            form,pumpkin beer is made with fresh, frozen, or pureed pumpkins that are fermented with
                            malted
                            grains. However, many producers do not even include pumpkin but opt for pumpkin-spice

                            and spices such as cinnamon, allspice, cloves, or nutmeg.

                            Weizenbock is a German beer style that was introduced in 1907 by the Schneider Weisse
                            Brauhaus
                            brewery located in Munich. Weizenbock was supposed to be a middle-ground between the rich
                            and
                            malty doppelbock and wheat beer (weissbier) that was popular at the time.The style comes in
                            a
                            pale and slightly darker version. Although both styles have a distinctive malt backbone,
                            darker
                            versions may have a richer malt profile and heavier toasty expressions with possible hints
                            of
                            caramel flavors and aromas of raisins and plums.

                            American barley wine originated from the original British style of barley wines—bold brews
                            with
                            strong malty flavors. The first examples of American-style barley wines appeared in 1975
                            with
                            the first version that was released by Anchor Brewing Co., which was then followed by Sierra
                            Nevada Brewing’s Bigfoot.The American version is also characterized by intense malt
                            character,
                            but unlike the British counterparts, American versions will usually have more assertive hop
                            flavors. The beers that fall into this style are typically rich, full-bodied, light amber to
                            medium copper, and luscious.

                            rustic style that grew out of necessity.

                            Despite its unusual name, English barley wine is a beer style that is often dubbed as the
                            grandfather of all brews. This style is strong, rich, and usually moderately hoppy with
                            pronounced malt flavors, and typical aromas of bread, toast, toffee, dried fruit, and
                            molasses.

                            and though these beers usually have high alcohol content, alcohol flavors are never harsh or
                            overpowering since the brews mellow with age. Their color is quite versatile and may include
                            deep gold and even dark brown varieties, but they are always full-bodied, complex, bold,
                            intense, smooth, and velvety.

                            Märzen is a German beer style from Bavaria that is closely connected with Oktoberfestbier
                            and
                            shares some similarities with Vienna lager. This style officially appeared in 1841 when it
                            was
                            brewed by Spaten brewery, but a similar style existed well before that.Märzen is an
                            amber-colored lager that has toasty malt aromas and flavors, dry finish, crisp hop
                            bitterness,
                            and a medium body. Original versions of these beers were somewhat darker, and as the name
                            suggests—Märzen translates as March—they were brewed in March and then left to lager until
                            early
                            fall.

                            Schwarzbier is a German dark lager style. These beers are not overly powerful or harsh, and
                            they
                            tend to be smooth and refreshing. The use of malted barley will give them a lightly roasted
                            malt
                            backbone that is accompanied by hints of chocolate, nuts, toast, and caramel.The finish is
                            dry,
                            clean and crisp, while hop bitterness is subtle and in good balance with its malty
                            character.
                            These beers would pair well with sausages, roasted or barbecued meat, washed-rind cheese
                            varieties, and chocolate or fruit desserts. Schwarzbier is often quoted as one of the oldest

                            Chimay Red was the first Trappist beer that was brewed by monks at the Scourmont Abbey, a
                            Trappist monastery in Chimay, Belgium. This amber-colored dubbel—a specific Trappist
                            style—is
                            made with ground malt (germinated and dried barley) and water that is exclusively drawn from

                            it is clarified, fermented, and stored. After the storage process, the beer is flat and

                            and active yeast is then added to create effervescence and to reach the desired alcohol

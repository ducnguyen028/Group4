                            Chocolate covered potato chips is an American invention that is commonly consumed as a
                            dessert
                            snack. Just like the name suggests, these snacks consist of thin potato chips that are
                            simply
                            dipped in melted chocolate. The chocolate may be regular milk chocolate, dark chocolate, or
                            white chocolate, and the chips are typically ridged because they can hold more chocolate
                            than
                            the regular, straight-cut variety.

                            Fried green tomatoes are a staple of Southern United States. The dish is made with firm,
                            unripe,
                            and tangy green tomatoes that are sliced, dipped in seasoned cornmeal, then deep-fried.
                            Ideally,
                            the tomatoes should have a crunchy crust and a succulent interior after the deep-frying.
                            Fried
                            green tomatoes are typically served as an appetizer or a side dish, and sometimes even as a
                            mid-afternoon snack. They can also be used as an ingredient for sandwiches, such as the
                            fried
                            green tomato po'boy.

                            made with roasted kabocha squash, flour, eggs, sugar, and spices. The combination is spooned

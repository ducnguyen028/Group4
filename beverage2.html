                            The 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon shows the best qualities of the year to great effect. Powerful,
                            incisive and tannic, yet also medium-bodied in structure, the 2014 is laser-focused and
                            exceptionally beautiful. Precision and finely sculpted, the 2014 is going to need at least a
                            few years to come into its own, but it is incredibly vivid and poised, even at this early
                            stage. Red fruit, wild flowers, orange peel and chalk add brightness throughout. -Antonio

                            The oldest Rieslings in our Josef Vineyard date back to the 1970s. These robust vines,
                            assisted by a warming lake effect and beneficial topography, produce consistently ripe fruit
                            of great flavor and intensity. Increased sugar densities from this rich site enable us to
                            craft Rieslings in the traditional Auslese style. Fresh and lively with medium viscosity and
                            clean finish, the Riesling Josef Vineyard pairs with a variety of full-flavored dishes and
                            will drink with distinction for years to come.

                            plants characteristic of Carmenère. Its generous percentage of Carmenère definitely sways
                            the juice to the savory side, giving the wine its almost salty swagger. Sappy and moderately
                            viscous, its still-youthful forest berry fruits remain energetically young. The tannins feel
                            like velvet, and there is plenty of mouthwatering lift thanks to the wine's generous
                            acidity.

                            the grapes looked to be well-developed, and a harvest date could be forecast. A superb
                            August sealed the deal. The Chardonnay flourished, gaining in ripeness until mid-September
                            when the harvest started in the Côte des Blancs, ensuring that 2008 would be an exceptional

                            Barolo Lecinquevigne is a blend of Nebbiolo from five vineyards located in the areas most
                            adept for the cultivation of this varietal. The grapes used for this prestigious blend are
                            grown in the calcareous-clay soils of Barolo, Grinzane Cavour, Monforte and Novello.
                            The wine has a very distinct look, and it’s difficult to guess its age. The Nebbiolo vines
                            range in age from 30 to 50 years old. The resulting wine has a ruby-red color with orange
                            highlights and leaves behind an intense fragrance of rose, leather, tobacco, and subtle
                            hints of violet and tar. The taste is broad and encompassing, leaving a compelling sensation
                            of softness in the mouth, with a long and persistent finish.

                            The wine leaves a scent in the glass that is really quite magical, drawing you into a
                            succulent palate which is broader and richer than its predecessor. Despite its six years in
                            barrel and a further six in bottle, the 2005 Tinto Reserva manages to retain a core of rich
                            red fruit which is perfectly complemented by the more mature, tertiary characters of its
                            age. This is beautiful Tondonia with the same open feel as the 2001 and would be supremely
                            enjoyable now whilst waiting for the 2004 to lose the last hint of its austerity. Don’t be
                            fooled though, as with all great Tondonia Tinto Reservas the 2005 promises to hold its
                            allure for many years to come.
